### **Beginner/Fundamental Questions**

These questions cover the basics of GitHub Actions and are great for gauging a candidate's understanding of the core concepts.


1.  **What are GitHub Actions, and why are they useful?**
    * **Answer:** GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) platform built directly into GitHub. It allows you to automate software workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying code, right within your repository. Its usefulness lies in streamlining the development process, improving code quality through automated checks, and enabling continuous delivery.



2.  **Explain the core components of a GitHub Actions workflow.**
    * **Answer:** A workflow is defined in a YAML file and typically consists of:
        * **Workflows:** The top-level automation process.
        * **Events:** Triggers that initiate a workflow run (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`).
        * **Jobs:** A set of steps that execute on the same runner. Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially.
        * **Steps:** Individual tasks within a job. A step can run a shell command, execute a script, or run an action.
        * **Actions:** Reusable units of code that perform specific tasks. They can be pre-built from the GitHub Marketplace, custom actions, or even shell scripts.
        * **Runners:** Virtual machines or containers that execute the jobs in a workflow. GitHub provides hosted runners, or you can use self-hosted runners.

3.  **What's the difference between GitHub-hosted runners and self-hosted runners? When would you choose one over the other?**
    * **Answer:**
        * **GitHub-hosted runners:** Managed by GitHub, they provide a clean virtual environment with common tools pre-installed. They're convenient for most public and many private repositories.
        * **Self-hosted runners:** You manage these on your own infrastructure. You'd choose them when you need specific hardware, operating systems, software, or network configurations not available on GitHub-hosted runners (e.g., on-premise deployments, specialized testing environments).

4.  **How do you define a workflow trigger? Give a few examples.**
    * **Answer:** Workflow triggers are defined using the `on:` keyword in the YAML file.
        * `on: push`: Triggers on every push to the repository.
        * `on: pull_request`: Triggers when a pull request is opened, updated, or synchronized.
        * `on: schedule`: Triggers on a specified cron schedule (e.g., `cron: '0 0 * * 1'` for weekly).
        * `on: workflow_dispatch`: Allows manual triggering of the workflow from the GitHub UI or API.

5.  **What are "actions" in GitHub Actions, and where do they come from?**
    * **Answer:** Actions are reusable building blocks for workflows. They encapsulate specific tasks like checking out code, setting up environments, running tests, or deploying. They can come from:
        * **GitHub Marketplace:** A vast collection of pre-built, community-contributed, and GitHub-official actions.
        * **Custom actions:** Actions you create yourself, either as JavaScript actions, Docker container actions, or composite run actions.

6.  **How do you manage secrets and sensitive information in GitHub Actions?**
    * **Answer:** GitHub Actions provides a built-in secrets store within repository or organization settings. Secrets are encrypted and not exposed in logs or workflow files. You access them in your workflow using the `secrets` context (e.g., `${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}`).

### **Intermediate Questions**

These questions delve deeper into workflow configuration and common use cases.

1.  **Explain the purpose of `jobs.<job_id>.steps`, `run`, and `uses` keywords.**
    * **Answer:**
        * `jobs.<job_id>.steps`: Defines a sequence of tasks to be executed within a specific job.
        * `run`: Executes a command-line program in the runner's shell. It's used for custom scripts or commands (e.g., `npm install`, `python test.py`).
        * `uses`: Executes a pre-defined action from the GitHub Marketplace or a custom action. It references an action by its path (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`, `./.github/actions/my-custom-action`).

2.  **How can you make jobs dependent on each other? (e.g., run job B only after job A completes successfully).**
    * **Answer:** You use the `needs:` keyword. For example:
        ```yaml
        jobs:
          build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - run: echo "Building..."
          test:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            needs: build # This job will run only after the 'build' job completes
            steps:
              - run: echo "Testing..."
        ```

3.  **What are artifacts in GitHub Actions? How are they used, and why are they important?**
    * **Answer:** Artifacts are files or directories generated during a workflow run that you want to save or share between jobs. They are important for:
        * **Passing data between jobs:** For example, a build job can upload a compiled binary as an artifact, and a deployment job can download and deploy it.
        * **Persisting build outputs:** Saving build logs, test reports, or compiled applications for later inspection or use.
        * You use `actions/upload-artifact` to upload and `actions/download-artifact` to download.

4.  **How do you implement conditional logic within a workflow or job? Give an example.**
    * **Answer:** You use the `if:` keyword, which evaluates a condition using expression syntax.
        * **Example (run a step only on main branch pushes):**
            ```yaml
            - name: Deploy to Production
              if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
              run: |
                echo "Deploying to production..."
            ```
        * **Example (run a job only on pull requests):**
            ```yaml
            jobs:
              lint:
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
                steps:
                  - run: echo "Linting code..."
            ```

5.  **Explain the `matrix` strategy in GitHub Actions. Why is it useful?**
    * **Answer:** The `matrix` strategy allows you to run the same job multiple times with different configurations (e.g., different operating systems, Node.js versions, Python versions, etc.). It's incredibly useful for:
        * **Cross-platform testing:** Testing your code on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
        * **Version compatibility testing:** Ensuring your application works with various versions of dependencies or runtimes.
        * **Parallel execution:** All jobs in a matrix run in parallel, significantly speeding up testing.

6.  **How can you cache dependencies in GitHub Actions to speed up workflow execution?**
    * **Answer:** You use the `actions/cache` action. It allows you to cache frequently used files and directories, such as `node_modules`, `pip caches`, etc. This reduces the time workflows spend downloading dependencies on subsequent runs, leading to faster execution. You specify a `key` for the cache and a `path` to the directory to cache.

### **Advanced/Scenario-Based Questions**

These questions test deeper knowledge, problem-solving skills, and experience with more complex GitHub Actions features.

1.  **Describe how you would implement a CI/CD pipeline for a web application using GitHub Actions, from code push to deployment.**
    * **Answer:** This is a broad question, and the ideal answer depends on the specific technologies. A good answer would cover:
        * **Triggers:** `on: push` to `main` and `pull_request` to `main`.
        * **Lint/Static Analysis Job:** Runs on `pull_request` to ensure code quality.
        * **Build Job:** Compiles the application (e.g., `npm run build`, `mvn package`). Uploads build artifacts.
        * **Test Job:** Runs unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests. May use a matrix strategy for different environments. Downloads build artifacts.
        * **Deployment Jobs:**
            * **Staging Deployment:** Triggers on `push` to `main`. Downloads artifacts and deploys to a staging environment (e.g., AWS S3/CloudFront, Azure App Service, Heroku).
            * **Production Deployment:** Could be triggered manually (e.g., `workflow_dispatch`), on a tag/release creation, or after successful staging tests. Requires careful use of environments and approvals.
        * **Secrets Management:** For API keys, cloud credentials, etc.
        * **Environment Variables:** For configuration.
        * **Notifications:** (Optional) Slack, email, etc., on success or failure.

2.  **How would you handle failed workflow runs? What debugging strategies do you employ?**
    * **Answer:**
        * **Monitoring Logs:** The primary way to debug is to examine the workflow run logs in the GitHub UI. Look for red "X" next to failing steps and read the output.
        * **Verbose Logging:** Setting `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` or using `::debug::` commands in scripts to get more detailed output.
        * **`continue-on-error`:** Temporarily setting `continue-on-error: true` for specific steps to allow the workflow to proceed and examine subsequent steps.
        * **Local Testing:** Using tools like `nektos/act` to run workflows locally (though it has limitations).
        * **Re-running jobs/workflows:** Utilizing GitHub's UI to re-run specific failed jobs or the entire workflow.
        * **Adding `echo` statements:** Temporarily adding `echo` statements to scripts to inspect variable values or execution paths.

3.  **Explain reusable workflows. When would you use them, and what are their benefits?**
    * **Answer:** Reusable workflows allow you to define a workflow once and then call it from multiple other workflows within the same repository or even across different repositories (if configured).
    * **Benefits:**
        * **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoids duplicating workflow logic.
        * **Consistency:** Ensures standardized CI/CD practices across projects.
        * **Maintainability:** Changes to a reusable workflow propagate to all calling workflows.
        * **Security:** Centralizes secrets and access control for common tasks.
    * **When to use:** For common build, test, deploy, or security scanning patterns that are repeated across several repositories or different parts of a large monorepo.

4.  **How do you implement concurrency control in GitHub Actions to prevent race conditions or resource exhaustion?**
    * **Answer:** You use the `concurrency` keyword at the workflow or job level.
        * `concurrency: <group_name>`: Ensures that only one workflow run in a given `group_name` can execute at a time.
        * `concurrency: <group_name>_ ${{ github.ref }}`: This is common to group by branch, preventing multiple runs on the same branch from interfering.
        * `concurrency: <group_name>_ ${{ github.ref }}_${{ github.sha }}` (or similar): To group by commit, useful for preventing multiple runs on the same commit.
        * `cancel-in-progress: true`: (Optional) Cancels any currently running jobs or workflows in the same concurrency group when a new one is triggered.

5.  **Discuss the use of environments in GitHub Actions. How do they enhance deployments and security?**
    * **Answer:** Environments allow you to define deployment targets with specific protection rules, secrets, and environment variables.
    * **Enhancements:**
        * **Protection Rules:** You can require manual approval for deployments, define specific branches that can deploy to an environment, or set a wait timer.
        * **Environment-Specific Secrets:** Secrets can be scoped to specific environments, ensuring that production secrets are only available to jobs deploying to the production environment.
        * **Deployment Tracking:** GitHub provides a history of deployments to each environment.
    * **Example:** Defining "Staging" and "Production" environments, with Production requiring manual approval and having different secrets.

6.  **You need to run a series of complex shell commands in a single step. How would you ensure proper execution and error handling, especially across different OS runners?**
    * **Answer:**
        * **Multi-line `run` scripts:** Use `|` (pipe) to define multi-line scripts.
        * **Shell specification:** Explicitly define the shell using `shell:` (e.g., `bash`, `powershell`, `pwsh`) to ensure consistent behavior across OS. Bash is generally good for cross-platform.
        * **Error Handling:**
            * `set -e` (for bash): Exits immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
            * `set -o pipefail` (for bash): Ensures that pipelines fail if any command in the pipeline fails.
            * Specific error handling constructs: `|| true` to suppress errors for non-critical commands, `&&` to chain commands, or `try-catch` blocks in PowerShell.
        * **Conditional execution:** Using `if:` statements to check for file existence or previous step outcomes.
        * **Logging:** Using `echo` and `::error::` for custom log messages and error annotations.

7.  **How would you test a custom GitHub Action that you developed before publishing it to the Marketplace or using it in your main workflows?**
    * **Answer:**
        * **Local testing:** Using tools like `nektos/act` to simulate GitHub Actions locally.
        * **Integration tests in a dedicated repository:** Create a separate repository specifically for testing the action. In that repository's workflow, reference your custom action using its local path (e.g., `uses: ./.github/actions/my-action`) or by referencing its main repository and a specific branch (e.g., `uses: octocat/my-action@my-test-branch`).
        * **Creating a test workflow:** Within the action's own repository, create a workflow that uses the action and runs various test cases.
        * **Version tagging:** Once stable, tag a release (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and use that tag in your main workflows.
